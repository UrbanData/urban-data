#Urban Data

A project for Space Apps, Guatemala City, 2014

Urban Data aims to create a mesh of sensors for cities. We use mesh networks, a Raspberry Pi and a bunch of sensors to detect urban micro climates, heatwaves and pollution. Starting with temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, CO2 and O and more sensors, Urban Data aims to provide an extensible platform to sense the environments in the city.

We currently measure: 
- Temperature 
- GPS position 
- Humidity 
- Atmosferic pressure
- O2 & CO2
